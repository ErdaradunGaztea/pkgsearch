        (PSI) values for user-specified genomic coordinates corresponding to alternative

        for representing and computing annotated genomic ranges by Lawrence (2013)

        ''Microsoft\u000aOffice'' / ''LibreOffice'', ''Latex'' and ''HTML'' Documents,
        using sensible defaults\u000athat result in publication-quality output with
        simple, straightforward commands.\u000aOutput to ''Microsoft Office'' is in
        editable ''DrawingML'' vector format for\u000agraphs, and can use corporate
        template documents for styling. This enables\u000athe production of standardized
        reports and also allows for manual tidy-up\u000aof the layout of ''R'' graphs
        in ''Powerpoint'' before final publication. Export\u000aof graphs is flexible,
        and functions enable the currently showing R graph\u000aor the currently showing
        ''R'' stats object to be exported, but also allow the\u000agraphical or tabular
        output to be passed as objects. The package relies on package\u000a''officer''
        for export to ''Office'' documents,and output files are also fully compatible\u000awith
        ''LibreOffice''. Base ''R'', ''ggplot2'' and ''lattice'' plots are supported,
        as\u000awell as a wide variety of ''R'' stats objects, via wrappers to xtable(),
        broom::tidy()\u000aand stargazer(), including aov(), lm(), glm(), lme(), glmnet()
