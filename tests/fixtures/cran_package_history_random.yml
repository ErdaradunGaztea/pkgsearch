        Fitness Analysis (QFA) is a complementary<U+000a>series of experimental and
        computational methods for estimating<U+000a>the fitness of thousands of microbial
        cultures in parallel.<U+000a>QFA is suitable for focussed, high-quality studies
        of the<U+000a>effect of genetic mutations or drug interventions on growth
        in<U+000a>model microbial organisms such as brewer''s yeast.  Culture<U+000a>growth
        is observed by time-lapse photography of solid agar<U+000a>plates inoculated
        with cultures in rectangular arrays.  Growth<U+000a>curves are constructed
        by analysing image series using<U+000a>Colonyzer image analysis software<U+000a>(http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer)
        which converts images to<U+000a>arrays of cell density estimates.  This R
        package is for a)<U+000a>fitting the generalised logistic model to potentially
        thousands<U+000a>of parallel growth curves, b) using inferred parameter values<U+000a>to
        calculate fitnesses for each culture and c) comparing<U+000a>fitnesses between
        QFA experiments with different genetic<U+000a>backgrounds or treatments to
        deduce interaction strengths.<U+000a>This package facilitates quantifying
        the fitness of thousands<U+000a>of independent microbial strains and tracking
        them throughout<U+000a>growth curve experiments.  With appropriately designed<U+000a>experiments,
        qfa can also estimate genetic interaction<U+000a>strengths and produce epistasis
